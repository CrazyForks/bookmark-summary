### What is Paged Out!?

**Paged Out! is a free experimental (one article == one page) technical magazine** about programming (especially programming tricks!), [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker), [security hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker), retro computers, modern computers, electronics, demoscene, and other similar topics.

It's **made by the community for the community**. And it's not-for-profit (though in time, we hope it will be self-sustained) - this means that the issues will always be free to download, share, and print. If you're interested in more details, check our our [FAQ](https://pagedout.institute/?page=faq.php) and [About](https://pagedout.institute/?page=about.php) pages!
